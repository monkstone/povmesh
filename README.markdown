# povmesh #

The povmesh library allows you to export toxilibs mesh objects as PovRAY mesh2 objects. This is the preferred way of exporting mesh objects as the mesh2 object more closely matches the way vertices are handled in PovRAY. For other processing sketches there is my [povwriter library](http://java.net/projects/povwriter/downloads), which allow instant preview.
